# RasPi-RFID-Spotify-player

This is a little project for my Raspberry pi journey. For this project I'm using Raspberry pi 4b and a RFID RC522 chip and of course couple of RFID tags.
Idea in a nutshell is to make a program which can:
Write a spotify song into the RFID tag. It can be either trough a direct link to the song or the name of it
Read the RFID chip. Then start playing the song in the specified Spotify account using a basic interaction with the Spotify API.
